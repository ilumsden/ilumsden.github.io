title: ORNL Internship&#58; Ipywe

During the summer of 2017, I participated in my first internship, and work experience in general, related to Computer Science. As a HERE program intern at Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL), I worked in the Neutron Data Analysis Group at the Spallation Neutron Source under the mentorship of Drs. Jiao Lin and Garrett Granroth. During this first summer, I worked on a project that would later be called [ipywe](https://github.com/scikit-beam/ipywe). 

The first part of this project involved me teaching myself the Python and JavaScript programming languages, how to use Jupyter Notebooks, and how to use Git. If you don't know, Python and JavaScript are two of the most important and popular programming languages today. Python is used predominantly for quick prototyping of code, creating performance-insensitive applications, and data analytics. It is also the language that has had the biggest impact in the spread and popularization of Artificial Intelligence. On the other hand, JavaScript is the most important programming language for the Internet. If you ever see a webpage that has any type of dynamic behavior (element movement, animations, color changes, etc.), that behavior was almost certainly created using JavaScript. Jupyter Notebooks are an extremely popular tool for Python programmers. They are essentially cell-based collections of code and text. Code cells in a notebook can be run iteratively or all together, while text cells help provide documentation and other useful information that augments the code. Finally, Git is one of the most important tools for modern programmers. It is the most used type of version-control software. In other words, it is used to allow multiple programmers to collaborate on the same project without having to worry about issues like having people overwriting each other's work. Git, alongside Git-based online code storage systems like GitHub and GitLab, are used by almost every programmer today to manage large (and oftentimes small) projects.

Once I learned these skills, I began developing ipywe, which is a collection of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for Jupyter Notebooks. These GUIs were designed to help scientists who use the neutron scattering instruments at SNS analyze their data. They range from convenience-based tools, like a file selector GUI, to analysis-centric ones, such as one that allows users to generate figures based on a selected cross-section of a data image. These tools were created using Jupyter's (rather lacking) documentation on creating custom widgets (their term for Jupyter GUIs). They use Python to handle changes to the underlying data of the GUI (model), and they use JavaScript to manage the interface that the user sees and interacts with (view). Jupyter itself serves as a platform to link the two sets of code together (controller).

There were two primary research outcomes of this project. First, there was the collection of GUIs, which can be found in the GitHub repository linked above. After I finished working on this project, the repository actually caught the attention of several researchers at Brookhaven National Laboratory, who worked with us to add it to a Python package called scikit-beam. The second outcome of this project was a set of comprehensive documentation (also found in the repository) on creating custom Jupyter widgets. To my knowledge, this documentation remains the most comprehensive information of its type today.

Going into this project, I was a little nervous and concerned about how I would do. I had never had an internship like this before, and my nervousness and concerns were only made worse by the fact that I was the only intern working on this project. In fact, I was actually the primary developer for this project. Additionally, I was at first unsure about my mentors, mainly due to the fact that they were both physicists. However, in the end, all my concerns were unfounded. Shortly after starting on the project, I discovered that learning new programming languages is actually quite simple if you already know at least one other. This discovery has since helped drive me to learn many new programming languages and programming paradigms that I likely would never have learned from my studies at UT. Additionally, I quickly learned that, even if my mentors were physicists by their education, they were still quite skilled and knowledgable in programming. This has helped my accept that, if they put enough effort into it, almost anyone can actually learn to be quite an impressive programmer. Learning about my mentors' knowledge also caused me to seek out their opinions and advice more. In turn, this helped me learn more from them than I likely would have otherwise.

If there was one thing I would like to change about my time on this project (besides my rather foolish assumption about my mentors' abilities), it would be the documentation that I put together on creating custom Jupyter widgets. Although I think what I put together is alright, I feel that I could do a much better job today, especially in terms of separating the most important information from lesser information.

_If you want to take a look at the widgets, see the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/scikit-beam/ipywe/tree/master/tests). If you want to see the documentation, check out [this directory](https://github.com/scikit-beam/ipywe/tree/master/docs) in the repository._
