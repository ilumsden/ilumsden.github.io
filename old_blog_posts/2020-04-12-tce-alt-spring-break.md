title: Alternative Spring Break in Nicaragua
categories: [Study Abroad, Reflections]

For Spring Break 2018, I went on the Tickle College of Engineering's Alternative Spring Break trip to Nicaragua. During the trip we got to experience this incredible country while also providing service by working on a permaculture farm. I would spend the rest of this article reflecting on it, but I feel like I already did a good job doing that in my Student Report that I prepared for the Tickle College of Engineering.

To find out more about the details of the trip, see [this webpage](https://tickle.utk.edu/alternative-spring-break-nicaragua/).
