In late November 2019, I traveled to Denver alongside the rest of my research group (the [Global Computing Lab](https://globalcomputing.group/)) to attend the 2019 IEEE/ACM Supercomputing Conference, or SC19 for short. This conference is the largest High-Performance Computing conference in the world, and I attended it as a student volunteer and exhibitioner for the University of Tennessee.
