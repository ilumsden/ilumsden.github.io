During the Fall semester of 2017 (my sophomore year), I joined the most important extracurricular of my college career: UT's IEEE Robotics team. Every year, the team's main goal is to build a fully autonomous robot to compete at the hardware competition at the annual IEEE SoutheastCon conference. To facilitate this, the team is divided into three subteams: software, electrical, and mechanical. As a Computer Science major, I was a member of the software team, although I also helped where I could with the other two. During my time on the team, I worked on various projects (usually related to the specific robot we were building). However, these can primarily be broken down into projects related to our larger Robotics Integrated Platform project and projects not related to this larger one.

For most of my time on the team, the main project for software members was developing code for our Robotics Integrated Platform, or RIP for short. RIP was meant to be a general purpose code library/platform for robotics that, in the long term, would make it easier to both reuse code and make new code for our new robots. Out of all the projects I worked on as a member of this robotics team, RIP was the one I was most enthusiastic about. It provided an immense challenge in terms of development, planning, and teamwork. Unfortunately, not everyone shared my enthusiasm about it. Over time, after the members who originally conceptualized the project left, the team began feeling that it was a burden due to previous design flaws and a lack of desire to spend time planning for a better version. In the end, despite my objections, the RIP project has slowly but surely died.

Since then, the main projects that I have been working on as part of the team involve more general robotics programming. Essentially, these projects involve choosing a particular piece of hardware to use as our main computer, finding compatible libraries, writing basic robot routines using these libraries, and linking these routines together into a (usually linear) run through the year's course. This shift in projects has unfortunately diminished my interest in the team and robotics in general, especially as my interests have been replaced by my work as a member of the [Global Computing Lab](https://globalcomputing.group/).

Although my interest and participation in the team has diminished as I approach graduation, I am still grateful for what I have learned as a member of it. Most importantly, being a member of IEEE Robotics has helped me become more open and has encouraged me to take on more of a leadership role in what I do. I am naturally a rather introverted person, but being on a closely knit team of friends with shared interests and goals has helped me open up more than I would have imagined. Additionally, since leadership in the team is based on experience and expertise, I was naturally thrust into a leadership role in the software subteam and the team as a whole. By having this role that I might have not otherwise sought out thrust upon me, I was forced to learn more about leadership, which has helped me grow more confident in leading others and in my abilities. 

Being a member of this team has also greatly benefited my career growth. In particular, my time on this team helped lead to my current interest in software engineering. Back when we worked on the RIP project, all the software members had to work to learn to use modern, team-focused software development tools, and everyone on the team (regardless of subteam) has always had to be in constant communication to ensure that something as complex as a fully autonomous robot would work. If the mechanical members designed the chasis of the robot without consulting the electrical members, the ciruit boards needed to power and control the robot would not fit. If the electrical team designed their circuit boards without a knowledge of the computing hardware the software team needed, either the robot would not function correctly, or it would set itself on fire (this actually happened the year before I joined the team). Even just amongst software members, if one coder wrote a piece of code without telling another the general design, the code that the two coders wrote could not be combined and would be useless towards the final goal of making a working robot. To that end, besides constant communication, all software members had to learn to program in a modern, team-oriented way that is illustrative of modern software engineering, and I loved it. In fact, this was the whole reason I liked the RIP project so much. Besides providing a challenge in terms of development and planning, RIP also encouraged us to follow this team-oriented development strategy. Sadly, since RIP was abandoned, the software subteam has started to become less of a collaborative group and more of a group of individuals who are willing to force their code together ad hoc, despite the best efforts to prevent this by me and the other software leaders. Although this change in environment has caused me to be less interested and devoted to the team, my time on the team, especially during the RIP project, has helped me to develop a true passion for modern, team-based software engineering to the point that, if someone were to ask me about my career, I would refer to myself first as a Software Engineer.
