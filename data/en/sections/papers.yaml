      summary: >
        Maintaining performant code in a world of fast-evolving computer architectures and
        programming models poses a significant challenge to scientists. Typically, benchmark
        codes are used to model some aspects of a large application code's performance, and
        are easier to build and run. Such benchmarks can help assess the effects of code or
        algorithm changes, system updates, and new hardware. However, most performance benchmarks
        are not written using a wide range of GPU programming models. The RAJA Performance Suite
        provides a comprehensive set of computational kernels implemented in a variety of programming
        models. We integrated the performance measurement and analysis tools Caliper and Thicket
        into the RAJAPerf to facilitate performance comparison across kernel implementations and
        architectures. This paper describes the RAJAPerf, performance metrics that can be collected,
        and experimental analysis with case studies.

      summary: >
        Deep Learning (DL) is increasingly applied across various fields to solve complex scientific
        challenges in modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems that are beyond the reach of
        traditional algorithms. Training DL models for scientific applications involves processing
        multi-terabyte datasets in each epoch. The data access behavior during DL training exposes
        optimization opportunities to cache these datasets in near-compute storage accelerators
        in HPC systems, enhancing I/O throughput. However, current middleware solutions employ
        near-compute storage accelerators primarily as exclusive caches, which limits the
        effectiveness of cache access locality. To address this problem, we introduce DYAD,
        a system designed to maximize sample locality in the cache, thereby significantly increasing
        I/O throughput in HPC systems.DYAD optimizes I/O for DL training based on three key features.
        First, DYAD boosts inter-node access speeds by using a novel streaming RPC with RDMA protocol,
        achieving a 1.25x performance gain over state-of-the-art solutions. Second, DYAD further enhances
        inter-node access by coordinating data movement, which mitigates network congestion and increases
        throughput for inter-node accesses by up to 8.78x. Last, DYAD uses smart metadata caching that
        outperforms traditional global metadata access methods by several orders of magnitude in terms
        of lookup throughput. We demonstrate how DYAD accelerates large-scale DL training on a high-end
        HPC cluster with 512 GPUs by up to 10.82x faster epochs compared to UnifyFS by performing
        locality-aware caching on near-compute storage accelerators.

      summary: >
        This experimental work examines data movement in molecular dynamics (MD) workflows,
        comparing the Dynamic and Asynchronous Data Streamliner (DYAD) middleware with traditional,
        industry-standard I/O systems such as XFS and Lustre. DYAD moves MD simulation frames to
        analytics processes, providing enhanced flexibility and efficiency for dynamic data transfers
        and in situ analytics. At the same time, traditional I/O storage systems provide durability
        and scalability for high-performance computing (HPC) systems. The study integrates MD workflows
        with common simulation codes, facilitating immediate capture and transfer of MD frames to a
        staging area. It explores various molecular models, from simple to complex, assessing data
        management performance and scalability. Different producer-consumer pairs, molecular models,
        and data transaction frequency enable testing across small to large-scale HPC scenarios,
        from single-node configurations to large, distributed environments. The findings reveal that
        adaptive mechanisms for minimizing synchronization, direct network communication between producer
        and consumer processes, and optimizations of both data movement and synchronization are crucial
        for performance and scalability in MD workflows.

    paper:
      summary: >
        Thicket is an open-source Python toolkit for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of multi-run performance
        experiments. It enables an understanding of optimal performance configuration for large-scale application
        codes. Most performance tools focus on a single execution (e.g., single platform, single measurement tool,
        single scale). Thicket bridges the gap to convenient analysis in multi-dimensional, multi-scale, multi-architecture,
        and multi-tool performance datasets by providing an interface for interacting with the performance data.
        Thicket has a modular structure composed of three components. The first component is a data structure
        for multi-dimensional performance data, which is composed automatically on the portable basis of call trees,
        and accommodates any subset of dimensions present in the dataset. The second is the metadata, enabling distinction
        and sub-selection of dimensions in performance data. The third is a dimensionality reduction mechanism, enabling
        analysis such as computing aggregated statistics on a given data dimension. Extensible mechanisms are available
        for applying analyses (e.g., top-down on Intel CPUs), data science techniques (e.g., K-means clustering from
        scikit-learn), modeling performance (e.g., Extra-P), and interactive visualization. We demonstrate the power
        and flexibility of Thicket through two case studies, first with the open-source RAJA Performance Suite on CPU
        and GPU clusters and another with a large physics simulation run on both a traditional HPC cluster and an AWS
        Parallel Cluster instance.

    paper:
      summary: >
        Exploiting task parallelism is getting increasingly difficult for diverse and complex
        scientific workflows running on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems.
        In this paper, we argue that the difficulty rises from a void in the spectrum of existing data-transfer
        models for resolving inter-task data dependence within a workflow and propose a novel model to fill that gap: Ubique.
        The Ubique model combines the best from in-transit and in situ models in order for loosely coupled producer
        and consumer tasks to run concurrently and to resolve their data dependencies efficiently with little or no
        modifications to their codes, striking a balance between transparent optimization, productivity, and performance.
        Our preliminary evaluation suggests that Ubique can significantly outperform the parallel file system (PFS)-based
        model while offering automatic data transfer and synchronization which are the features lacking in many traditional models.
        It also identifies the performance characteristics of its key depending subsystems, which must be understood for further
        broadening its benefits.

    paper:
      summary: >
        As computational science applications benefit from larger-scale, more heterogeneous
        high performance computing (HPC) systems, the process of studying their performance
        becomes increasingly complex. The performance data analysis library Hatchet provides
        some insights into this complexity, but is currently limited in its analysis capabilities.
        Missing capabilities include the handling of relational caller-callee data captured by HPC profilers.
        To address this shortcoming, we augment Hatchet with a Call Path Query Language that
        leverages relational data in the performance analysis of scientific applications.
        Specifically, our Query Language enables data reduction using call path pattern matching.
        We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Query Language in identifying performance bottlenecks
        and enhancing Hatchet’s analysis capabilities through three case studies.
        In the first case study, we compare the performance of sequential and multi-threaded versions
        of the graph alignment application Fido. In doing so, we identify the existence of large memory
        inefficiencies in both versions. In the second case study, we examine the performance of MPI calls
        in the linear algebra mini-application AMG2013 when using MVAPICH and Spectrum-MPI.
        In doing so, we identify hidden performance losses in specific MPI functions.
        In the third case study, we illustrate the use of our Query Language in Hatchet's interactive visualization.
        In doing so, we show that our Query Language enables a simple and intuitive way to massively reduce profiling data.

        Performance analysis is critical for pinpointing bottlenecks in parallel applications.
        Several profilers exist to instrument parallel programs on HPC systems and gather performance data.
        Hatchet is an open-source Python library that can read profiling output of several tools, and enables
        the user to perform a variety of programmatic analyses on hierarchical performance profiles.
        In this paper, we augment Hatchet to support new features: a query language for representing call path patterns
        that can be used to filter a calling context tree, visualization support for displaying
        and interacting with performance profiles, and new operations for performing analyses on multiple datasets.
        Additionally, we present performance optimizations in Hatchet’s HPCToolkit reader and the unify operation
        to enable scalable analysis of large datasets.

      summary: >
        Independently of the image modality (x-rays, neutrons, etc), image data analysis requires normalization,
        a preprocessing step. While the normalization can sometimes easily be generalized, the analysis is,
        in most cases, specific to an experiment and a sample. Although many tools (MATLAB, ImageJ, VG Studio...)
        offer a large collection of pre-programmed image analysis tools, they usually require a learning step
        that can be lengthy depending on the skills of the end user. We have implemented Jupyter Python notebooks
        to allow easy and straightforward data analysis, along with live interaction with the data.
        Jupyter notebooks require little programming knowledge and the steep learning curve is bypassed.
        Most importantly, each notebook can be tailored to a specific experiment and sample with minimized effort.
        Here, we present the pros and cons of the main methods to analyse data and show the reason why
        we have found that Jupyter Python notebooks are well suited for imaging data processing, visualization and analysis.

        MCViNE is an open source, object-oriented Monte Carlo neutron ray-tracing simulation software package.
        Its design allows for flexible, hierarchical representations of sophisticated instrument components
        such as detector systems, and samples with a variety of shapes and scattering kernels. Recently this
        flexible design has enabled several applications of MCViNE simulations at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS)
        at Oak Ridge National Lab, including assisting design of neutron instruments at the second target station
        and design of novel sample environments, as well as studying effects of instrument resolution
        and multiple scattering. Here we provide an overview of the recent developments and new features of MCViNE
        since its initial introduction (Jiao et al 2016 Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res.,
        Sect. A 810, 86–99), and some example applications.

        covering the problem domain. Of particular importance for (inelastic) fracture analysis is that
        the volume integral over the regular grid is computed without explicit knowledge of the domain boundary,
        including the fracture surface. A Galerkin approximation is employed, and the numerical implementation is
        validated by solving body force elasticity problems with known solutions.
