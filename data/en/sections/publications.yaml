      summary: >
        As computational science applications benefit from larger-scale, more heterogeneous
        high performance computing (HPC) systems, the process of studying their performance
        becomes increasingly complex. The performance data analysis library Hatchet provides
        some insights into this complexity, but is currently limited in its analysis capabilities.
        Missing capabilities include the handling of relational caller-callee data captured by HPC profilers.
        To address this shortcoming, we augment Hatchet with a Call Path Query Language that
        leverages relational data in the performance analysis of scientific applications.
        Specifically, our Query Language enables data reduction using call path pattern matching.
        We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Query Language in identifying performance bottlenecks
        and enhancing Hatchet’s analysis capabilities through three case studies.
        In the first case study, we compare the performance of sequential and multi-threaded versions
        of the graph alignment application Fido. In doing so, we identify the existence of large memory
        inefficiencies in both versions. In the second case study, we examine the performance of MPI calls
        in the linear algebra mini-application AMG2013 when using MVAPICH and Spectrum-MPI.
        In doing so, we identify hidden performance losses in specific MPI functions.
        In the third case study, we illustrate the use of our Query Language in Hatchet's interactive visualization.
        In doing so, we show that our Query Language enables a simple and intuitive way to massively reduce profiling data.

      summary: >
        Performance analysis is critical for pinpointing bottlenecks in parallel applications.
        Several profilers exist to instrument parallel programs on HPC systems and gather performance data.
        Hatchet is an open-source Python library that can read profiling output of several tools, and enables
        the user to perform a variety of programmatic analyses on hierarchical performance profiles.
        In this paper, we augment Hatchet to support new features: a query language for representing call path patterns
        that can be used to filter a calling context tree, visualization support for displaying
        and interacting with performance profiles, and new operations for performing analyses on multiple datasets.
        Additionally, we present performance optimizations in Hatchet’s HPCToolkit reader and the unify operation
        to enable scalable analysis of large datasets.

      summary: >
        Independently of the image modality (x-rays, neutrons, etc), image data analysis requires normalization,
        a preprocessing step. While the normalization can sometimes easily be generalized, the analysis is,
        in most cases, specific to an experiment and a sample. Although many tools (MATLAB, ImageJ, VG Studio...)
        offer a large collection of pre-programmed image analysis tools, they usually require a learning step
        that can be lengthy depending on the skills of the end user. We have implemented Jupyter Python notebooks
        to allow easy and straightforward data analysis, along with live interaction with the data.
        Jupyter notebooks require little programming knowledge and the steep learning curve is bypassed.
        Most importantly, each notebook can be tailored to a specific experiment and sample with minimized effort.
        Here, we present the pros and cons of the main methods to analyse data and show the reason why
        we have found that Jupyter Python notebooks are well suited for imaging data processing, visualization and analysis.

        MCViNE is an open source, object-oriented Monte Carlo neutron ray-tracing simulation software package.
        Its design allows for flexible, hierarchical representations of sophisticated instrument components
        such as detector systems, and samples with a variety of shapes and scattering kernels. Recently this
        flexible design has enabled several applications of MCViNE simulations at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS)
        at Oak Ridge National Lab, including assisting design of neutron instruments at the second target station
        and design of novel sample environments, as well as studying effects of instrument resolution
        and multiple scattering. Here we provide an overview of the recent developments and new features of MCViNE
        since its initial introduction (Jiao et al 2016 Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res.,
        Sect. A 810, 86–99), and some example applications.

      Grid-Based Volume Integration for Elasticity: Traction Boundary Integral Equation

      summary: >
        A volume integral algorithm for the non-homogeneous elasticity traction boundary integral equation is presented.
        The body force volume integral is exactly split into a relatively simple boundary integral,
        together with a remainder volume integral that can be evaluated using a regular grid of cuboid cells
        covering the problem domain. Of particular importance for (inelastic) fracture analysis is that
        the volume integral over the regular grid is computed without explicit knowledge of the domain boundary,
        including the fracture surface. A Galerkin approximation is employed, and the numerical implementation is
        validated by solving body force elasticity problems with known solutions.
